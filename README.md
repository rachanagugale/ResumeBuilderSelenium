# ResumeBuilderSelenium

The workflow for the website is:
1. The user will login or register first.
2. If the user has logged in, in the next page he will be asked to choose whether to use previously stored data or enter new data.
3. If the user chooses the old data option, in the next page, he will be asked to choose a template and the generated resume will be displayed.
4. If the user chooses the new data option, the user will be asked to choose a template on the next page followed by pages asking him to enter his personal info, educational details, skills and cover letter in the subsequent pages. In the end, this new data will replace the old data in the database and the generated resume will be displayed.
5. If the user is a newly registered user, he won't have any saved data and so he will be shown the choose a template, personal details, educational details, skills and coverletter page in that order respectively.
